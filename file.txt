I’ll give you a clear, skimmable picture of how the Bedrock Agent in this project works end to end.

What this project does
A small Python CLI manages an Amazon Bedrock Agent via boto3.
It handles the agent lifecycle: create → prepare → alias → invoke.
It streams the agent’s response back to your terminal.
Lifecycle flow (control plane)
Configure

You provide: AWS Region, Agent name, Foundation model, Instruction (≥ 40 chars), and the Agent execution role ARN.
Credentials come from your env/profile or from CLI flags.
Create agent

CLI calls Bedrock Agents CreateAgent with your instruction/model/role.
If it already exists (same name), we return the existing agent (idempotent).
Prepare agent

CLI calls PrepareAgent; Bedrock builds a deployable version.
We poll status until PREPARED and capture the version.
Create alias

CLI creates an alias (e.g., prod) that points to the prepared version.
You can later move this alias to a newer version after re-prepare.
Update role (optional)

If you change the execution role (permissions), update the agent and re-prepare.
Invocation flow (runtime)
Input: agent ID (or ARN) + alias (name/ID/ARN) + your prompt text.
The CLI calls Bedrock Agent Runtime InvokeAgent.
Bedrock Agent orchestrates the foundation model (and tools/KBs if configured).
Response is streamed back as events; the CLI assembles chunks and prints the final text.
Identities and permissions
Caller (your IAM user/role) must have:
bedrock:InvokeAgent on the agent/alias ARN.
bedrock:InvokeModelWithResponseStream on “*” (model streaming).
Optional list/get permissions if you want to browse agents/aliases.
Agent execution role (you supply its ARN) is what the agent uses at runtime to call models/tools.
Common pitfalls
Instruction too short (< 40 chars) → Bedrock validation error.
Invoke before PREPARED or alias not pointing to PREPARED version → empty/no reply.
Missing InvokeAgent/InvokeModelWithResponseStream permissions → AccessDenied.
No List permissions → can’t browse aliases; pass alias ID/ARN directly instead.
Quick flow recap
Create → Prepare → Alias → Invoke
To update behavior: change instruction/role → Prepare again → Move alias → Invoke.
If you want, I can run a quick check: print your caller identity, list agents, and show the alias target to confirm everything is wired before invoking.
